>[!TIP]
>SunCalc is made by AP Students, for AP Students. Other than a fully functional calculator, it is meant for other AP students to learn and enhance. AP CSA doesn't cover nearly enough, which is why our backend barebones calculator can not only be utilized for mathematical purposes, but also for educational purposes regarding computer science.
