## Overview
The **Games Module** provides a collection of interactive betting-style mini-games, all accessed through the **SunGames** hub.  
Players start with a fixed amount of virtual currency, managed through the `Currency` class, and can place bets on various games.  
The `Strike` system ensures fair play by tracking invalid betting attempts.

âš  **Important Disclaimer:**  
All games are for entertainment purposes only. The virtual currency used in these games has **no real-world value** and should not be confused with gambling involving actual money.
